# Learning Path: Recommendation Models

Welcome to the learning path for recommendation models! This guide is designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts of recommendation systems and progressively learn about various models, from simple to complex. Each section will provide conceptual explanations and link to relevant examples in this repository.

## 1. Introduction to Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems are a type of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. They are widely used in various applications like e-commerce, social media, and content platforms.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Explicit Feedback:** Users directly provide their preferences (e.g., ratings, reviews).
*   **Implicit Feedback:** User preferences are inferred from their behavior (e.g., clicks, views, purchases).
*   **Cold Start Problem:** Difficulty in making recommendations for new users or new items due to lack of historical data.
*   **Sparsity:** User-item interaction matrices are often sparse, meaning most users have not interacted with most items.
*   **Scalability:** Recommendation systems need to handle large amounts of data and users efficiently.

**Common Types of Recommendation Approaches:**

*   **Collaborative Filtering:** Based on the idea that users who agreed in the past will agree in the future.
*   **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends items similar to those a user liked in the past, based on item attributes.
*   **Hybrid Approaches:** Combine collaborative and content-based methods to leverage their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses.

## 2. Basic Recommendation Models

Let's start with some fundamental recommendation models.

### 2.1. Collaborative Filtering (CF)

Collaborative filtering techniques build a model from a user's past behavior (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users.

#### 2.1.1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)

*   **Concept:** Recommends items to a user that similar users have liked. It finds users with similar rating patterns to the target user and uses their ratings to predict what the target user might like.
*   **Example:** [`examples/collaborative_filtering/user_cf_example.py`](examples/collaborative_filtering/user_cf_example.py)
*   **When to use:** When user preferences are relatively stable and there are enough users with overlapping interests.
*   **Limitations:** Suffers from data sparsity and the new user cold-start problem. Computationally expensive to find similar users as the number of users grows.

#### 2.1.2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)

*   **Concept:** Recommends items that are similar to items a user has liked in the past. It calculates similarity between items based on user rating patterns.
*   **Example:** [`examples/collaborative_filtering/item_cf_example.py`](examples/collaborative_filtering/item_cf_example.py)
*   **When to use:** When item characteristics are relatively stable. Often more scalable and stable than UBCF.
*   **Limitations:** Suffers from data sparsity and the new item cold-start problem. May not provide diverse recommendations.

### 2.2. Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s preferences. These methods are best suited for situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user.

#### 2.2.1. TF-IDF Based Recommendation

*   **Concept:** Uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to represent item content (e.g., text descriptions, genres). It then recommends items with content similar to what a user has liked.
*   **Example:** [`examples/content_based/tfidf_example.py`](examples/content_based/tfidf_example.py)
*   **When to use:** When items have rich textual descriptions. Good for handling the item cold-start problem.
*   **Limitations:** Relies heavily on feature engineering. May recommend items too similar to what the user already knows (limited serendipity).

### 2.3. Matrix Factorization

Matrix factorization techniques decompose the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional latent factor matrices for users and items.

#### 2.3.1. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

*   **Concept:** A popular matrix factorization technique that decomposes the user-item matrix into three matrices. It captures latent factors representing underlying user preferences and item characteristics.
*   **Example:** [`examples/matrix_factorization/svd_example.py`](examples/matrix_factorization/svd_example.py)
*   **When to use:** Effective for handling sparse data and uncovering latent relationships.
*   **Limitations:** Can be computationally intensive for very large matrices. Interpretability of latent factors can be challenging.

## 3. Advanced Recommendation Models

These models often leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to capture more complex patterns.

### 3.1. Deep Learning Based Recommendation

Deep learning models can learn complex non-linear relationships from data, leading to more accurate recommendations.

#### 3.1.1. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with Embeddings

*   **Concept:** Uses embedding layers to learn dense vector representations (embeddings) for users and items. These embeddings are then fed into a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict user-item interactions (e.g., ratings).
*   **Example:** [`examples/deep_learning/dnn_recommender.py`](examples/deep_learning/dnn_recommender.py)
*   **When to use:** When there's a large amount of interaction data. Can capture complex patterns and easily incorporate various features.
*   **Limitations:** Requires significant data and computational resources. Can be a "black box" in terms of interpretability. Suffers from cold-start problems.

### 3.2. Sequential Recommendation Models

Sequential recommenders aim to predict the user's next action based on the sequence of their past interactions.

#### 3.2.1. SASRec (Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation)

*   **Concept:** A Transformer-based model that uses self-attention mechanisms to capture sequential patterns in user behavior. It focuses on the order and context of item interactions.
*   **Example:** [`examples/sequential/transformer_sasrec_example.py`](examples/sequential/transformer_sasrec_example.py)
*   **When to use:** When the order of interactions is important (e.g., recommending the next song, video, or product).
*   **Limitations:** Requires sequential data. Can be computationally intensive for very long sequences.

### 3.3. Hybrid Recommendation Models

Hybrid models combine two or more recommendation techniques to achieve better performance and overcome limitations of individual methods.

#### 3.3.1. Two-Tower Hybrid Model

*   **Concept:** Consists of two separate neural networks (towers) – one for users and one for items. Each tower learns embeddings for its respective entity. The similarity between user and item embeddings is then used for recommendations.
*   **Example:** [`examples/hybrid/two_tower_hybrid_example.py`](examples/hybrid/two_tower_hybrid_example.py)
*   **When to use:** Effective for large-scale recommendation systems. Allows for efficient retrieval of candidates by pre-computing item embeddings.
*   **Limitations:** The interaction between user and item features is typically modeled late (e.g., via dot product), which might be less expressive than more integrated models.

### 3.4. Graph-Based Recommendation Models (GNNs)

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model user-item interactions as a graph and leverage graph learning techniques for recommendations.

#### 3.4.1. LightGCN (Light Graph Convolution Network)

*   **Concept:** A simplified GNN model that learns user and item embeddings by performing linear propagation on the user-item interaction graph. It removes feature transformations and non-linearities used in traditional GCNs, making it more efficient and often more effective for recommendation.
*   **Example:** [`examples/gnn/lightgcn_tf_example.py`](examples/gnn/lightgcn_tf_example.py)
*   **When to use:** When user-item interactions can be naturally represented as a bipartite graph. Has shown strong performance in many benchmarks.
*   **Limitations:** Can suffer from over-smoothing with too many layers.

#### 3.4.2. NGCF (Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering)

*   **Concept:** Explicitly models high-order connectivity in the user-item graph by propagating embeddings. It aims to capture more complex collaborative signals.
*   **Example:** [`examples/gnn/ngcf_example.py`](examples/gnn/ngcf_example.py) (Note: This example might be a placeholder or simplified version. Full implementation details are in the paper.)
*   **When to use:** When exploring higher-order relationships in the interaction graph is beneficial.
*   **Limitations:** Can be more complex and computationally intensive than LightGCN.

#### 3.4.3. PinSage

*   **Concept:** A GNN model developed by Pinterest for web-scale recommendation on massive graphs. It uses random walks and graph convolutions with importance pooling to generate item embeddings.
*   **Example:** [`examples/gnn/pinsage_example.py`](examples/gnn/pinsage_example.py) (Note: This example might be a placeholder or simplified version. Full implementation details are in the paper.)
*   **When to use:** For very large-scale industrial applications with rich item features and graph structure.
*   **Limitations:** Complex to implement and train. Requires significant computational resources.

#### 3.4.4. GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) for Recommendation

*   **Concept:** A general GCN applied to user-item interaction graphs. It aggregates information from neighboring nodes to learn embeddings.
*   **Example:** [`examples/gnn/gcn_example.py`](examples/gnn/gcn_example.py) (Note: This example might be a placeholder or simplified version.)
*   **When to use:** As a foundational GNN approach for recommendation tasks.
*   **Limitations:** Standard GCNs might include components (non-linearities, feature transformations) that are not always optimal for recommendation compared to specialized models like LightGCN.

#### 3.4.5. GraphSAGE for Recommendation

*   **Concept:** An inductive GNN model that learns a function to generate embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Can generate embeddings for unseen nodes.
*   **Example:** [`examples/gnn/graphsage_example.py`](examples/gnn/graphsage_example.py) (Note: This example might be a placeholder or simplified version.)
*   **When to use:** When dealing with evolving graphs or needing to generate embeddings for new users/items (inductive capability).
*   **Limitations:** Performance can depend on the choice of aggregator and sampling strategy.

#### 3.4.6. GAT (Graph Attention Network) for Recommendation

*   **Concept:** Incorporates attention mechanisms into graph convolutions, allowing nodes to assign different weights to their neighbors during information aggregation.
*   **Example:** [`examples/gnn/gat_example.py`](examples/gnn/gat_example.py) (Note: This example might be a placeholder or simplified version.)
*   **When to use:** When different neighbors have varying importance for a node's representation.
*   **Limitations:** Can be computationally more expensive than simpler GCN models.
